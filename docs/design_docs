Requirement:
1. Auto Scaling

akka-cluster-sharding => two level: multi cores, distributed

2. Fault Tolerance /HA

recovery locally after restart

recovery in another machine

recovery speed

3. streaming support

delta table, etc.


Stage 1 (elastic):

1. Separate the tables into multiple nodes, each node maintains one or more hash table

2. Insert process

send the new query to all nodes, to insert them to the hash tables

3. query process

send the query to all nodes, each node query the information in the hashtable it maintains, and return the result


4. auto sharding when the response time is too large
